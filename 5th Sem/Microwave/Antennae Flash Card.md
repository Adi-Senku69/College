# Antennae Flash Card

## Definitions

`Isotropic Antenna:` Radiates equally in all directions.

`Directional Antenna:` Radiates in a particular direction.

`Omnidirectional Antenna:` Radiates in a plane. **Major lobe** is in a plane. **NO BACK LOBE**

`Major Lobe:` The primary region in which the antenna radiates and receives electromagnetic energy.

`Half Power Bandwidth:` Angular width of major lobe, from **max** to **3db** down.

`First Null Beam Width:` Width of major lobe.

`Front to back ratio:` Ratio of gain from major lobe to back lobe.

`Beam Width:` The ability of the system to separate two adjacent targets.

$$
\Omega_A = \iint_{\theta = 0\ \phi = 0}^{\phi = 2\pi \ \theta = 2\pi}{P(\theta, \phi)} \, d\theta \ d\phi
$$

`Beam Area:` The solid angle through which all of the power radiated by antenna would stream if $P(\theta, \phi)$ is maintained its maximum value over $\Omega_A$ and was 0.

`Radiation Intensity:` Power radiated by antenna per **unit solid angle**.

$$
Radiation \ Intensity = \frac{E^2 r^2}{2 \eta}
$$

$$
P_{red} = \iint_{\theta\phi} U sin\theta \,d\theta \ d\phi = \int U \ d\Omega
$$

`Beam efficiency:` Ratio of main beam area to the total beam area.

$$
\Omega_A = \Omega_m + \Omega_M
$$

$$
\epsilon_m = \frac{\Omega_M}{\Omega_A} 
$$

`Directivity:` The ratio of **total solid angle** of the sphere to **beam solid angle.** Or it is the measure of the concentration of radiated power in a particular direction. $D \ge 1$

`Gain:` Measure of ability of antenna to direct energy in a particular direction as compared to an isotropic antenna.

`Aperture:` Area through which power is radiated or received.

`Effective Aperture:` Ratio of the **available power at the terminals** of the antenna to the **power flux density of a plane** wave incident upon the antenna, which is matched to the antenna in terms of polarization.

$$
\epsilon_p = \frac{A_e}{A_p}
$$

`Effective Height:` Provides an indication as to how much of the antenna is involved in radiating or receiving. 

`Antenna Temperature:` Measure of noise received by an antenna.

$$
P_{received} = k . T_{ant}.B
$$

B is the effective bandwidth  
k is the boltzman constant  
T is the antenna temperature
