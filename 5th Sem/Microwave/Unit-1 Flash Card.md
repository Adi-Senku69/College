## **Klystron**

These are devices which are used for
`amplification or generation` of `microwave`
frequencies.

### Two Cavity Klystron:

This is a `Amplification device`. In this device consists of
two cavities, a buncher cavity and a catcher cavity and the space
between the two cavities is known as drift space. The power source is
connected in such a way that the anode is connected to the front of the
tube and the cathode is connencted to the electron gun.Refer the notes
for the diagram. When the RF input is providedinto the buncher chamber,
an electric field is generated. The electric gun provides the required
electrons. Due to the generation of electric field, the electrons
undergo velocity modulation, wherein the speed of the electrons are
varied in accordance with the RF input. Due to the varying velociy, in
the drift space, the electrons tend to group together, and thus are
collected in the collector cavity. Due to such phenomenon the RF output
is an amplified version of the RF input.

**Applications:**

- Satellite communication - UHF TV transmitters - radar systems

### **Reflex Klystron**

**Working:**

This is a `oscillation device`. This device consists of 1
cavity but `two` power sources. One power source is connected
to the repeller which helps in velocity modulation. And the other power
source provides power to the electron gun. The electrons generated pass
through the tube, where some electrons move towards the cavity while the
other electrons are reppelled by the repeller. Due to this, the
electrons face a retarding force which force the electrons to bunch
together and are collected in the cavity.

`Early electron:` This electron has a strong electric field
generated in the cavity due to which this electron, penetrates deep into
the cavity, due to which a high repelling potential.

`Reference electron:` When no potential is given to the gun,
the electrons travel with a uniform velocity and this electron is known
as reference electron.

`Late electron:` This electron which is emitted in the
presence of a high negative potential is known as a late electron and
does not have much velocity.

`Transit time:` The time taken by the electron to return to
the cavity of getting repelled. [^1]

[^1]: Refer Applegate diagrams ## Magnetron This is a
`high power vaccum tube` used to generate microwaves. These
devices are extremely `costly` and are built for a particular
frequency. They come in sizes ranging from 8-20 cavities. Taking the
example of an 8 cavity magnetron:-

**Construction and Working:**

The device consists of a cylinder with 8 cavities which are 180 degree
apart in phase. The parallel sides of the cavity act as an capacitor,
therfore have opposite polarity. This forms a closed electric field. The
centre of the magnetron consists of the cathode, and the RF input is
provided to the cavities. The curved portion acts as an inductor. The
space between the anode and cathode is called the
`space region`.

`Case - 1:`

When no magnetic field is present, the electrons from the cathode move
towards the anode, without any deviation. This is done when there is no
RF input.

`Case - 2:`

When there is a small magnetic field, the electrons bend and veer from
the original path and take a curved path towards the anode.

`Case - 3:`

When there is a strong magnetic field, the electrons deviate from the
path greatly and sometimes do not reach the anode at all.

The above cases happen due to the fact that `F = q(v X B)`.
This induces velocity modulation, which causes the electrons to bunch
together and undergo oscillation, which is then used for other
applications.

**Advantages**

Highly efficient, and the use of this device in radars increase the
quality for tracking purposes.

**Disadvantages**

Extremely expensive, and despite the fact that it generates a wide range
of frequencies, it is hard to control it.

**Applications**

- Pulsed radar systems - Heating appliances.

## Traveling wave tube

This device is used for `amplification` and accounts for
50% of its use in microwave engineering. This devices consists of a
tube, with an electron gun, focusing plates, magnets and a slow wave
structure with attenuators. The slow wave structure is in the form of a
helix. The focusing plates and the attenuators focus the electrons into
the slow wave structure. Due to the presence of magnetic field, the
electrons fired from the gun, depeding on the RF input start to undergo
deviation, as they undergo velocity modulation, where the distance
traveled by the electron increases thus, varying the velocity. Due to
this, the electrons start grouping together and produce a difference in
phase, but the output is amplified to a great extent.

**Need for slow wave structure:** Due to the fact that the
RF input is at the speed of light, if we were to increase the velocity,
it would only be to a fraction to the speed of light. Therefore, it is
more cost effective to slow down the RF input to match phase of the
electron beam and to induce grouping due to velocity modulation.

**Applications:**

- Output tube in radar - Microwave amplifier - Microwave high power
